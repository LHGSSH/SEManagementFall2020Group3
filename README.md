This is a subscription-based ice cream service where users can pick out a box of ice cream to be sent to them. The box can contain pre-selected flavors, or custom, user-selected flavors. On the main page, there is a list of available flavors. On the subscriptions page, the available subscription packages are displayed. The about us page contains info about the project. Use the links near the top of the page to manuever around the site.

As of Milestone 4, the user can now add flavors to a shopping cart and go to a checkout page. Also, the project now works with docker-compose.

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
- Use "docker-compose up" in the main folder
- MAKE SURE YOU'RE DOING THIS ON LINUX! The project does not work on Windows/Mac
