This is a subscription-based ice cream service where users can pick out a box of ice cream to be sent to them. The box can contain pre-selected flavors, or custom, user-selected flavors. On the main page, there is a list of available flavors. On the subscriptions page, the available subscription packages are displayed. The about us page contains info about the project. Use the links near the top of the page to manuever around the site.

As of Milestone 3, the user can now search through the inventory to see what ice cream flavors are available. There are now running Docker containers for each part of the app. However, there are CORS errors when trying to use the site through the Docker images, so right now, the user must run the apps normally for full functionality. Also, any bugs from Milstone 2 are now fixed!
