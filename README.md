This is a subscription-based ice cream service where users can pick out a box of ice cream to be sent to them. The box can contain pre-selected flavors, or custom, user-selected flavors. On the main page, there is a list of available flavors. On the subscriptions page, the available subscription packages are displayed. The about us page contains info about the project. Use the three links near the top of the page to manuever around the site.
